# DNA-Sequencing-with-nanopores
This repository will contain a ML-enhanced software for NanoPore based DNA Sequencing
This software is based and extends on my previous work in Drndic's Lab at Univeristy Of Pennsylvania. This work might be at some point continued by Goeppert(http://gppert.com/)

The software should be able to detect events in raw or Chimera format.
This version is implemented in Matlab, but should work also on Octave.

The .dat file is one of sequence of DNA events. 

I will add (soon I hope) a version in python in which we use ML to improve  events detection and classification.

Bellow is an image of the results / analyse of a symple DNA translocation experiment using this software.
